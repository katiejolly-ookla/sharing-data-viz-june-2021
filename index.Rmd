On Reddit: 

> That southeast part of Richmond that is rural is called Varina and it is exactly like this map depicts. This oddly rural area abutting the city where you can go from near downtown to the middle of a bean field in a tenth of a mile or two.

Alex Fries on Twitter:
 > Great map! I’ve looked at the dataset you used for it before—off the top of my head, I know it’s missing the Perdido River on the AL-FL border. There’s also the Pigeon, Pine, and Granite Rivers on the eastern MN-ON border, though those are easy to miss with all the lakes there!
